## Details
This was a fun 3-week project to learn about PCB making, and it was fun modeling the case. It took a lot of questions on Slack and tutorials, but here it is.

### Future Plans
I'm planning on using transparent 3d filament for the base so the light can glow on the bottom. This will also be used for my Hack Club at my school as an example project.
